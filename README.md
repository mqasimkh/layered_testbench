## Task â€“ 1: Building Transaction Class

Added memory interface signals as class properties in `transaction` class.  
The modified code for transaction class is:

*(code not shown here, assumed to be in the repo)*

## Task â€“ 2: Creating Generator and Driver Classes

### Generator Class

In `generator` class, created randomized transactions and sent them to the driver and scoreboard using two mailboxes:  
- `gen2drv`  
- `gen2scr`  

These mailboxes work like FIFO queues â€” one sends transactions to the driver, and the other to the scoreboard.  
`event complete` is used to signal when generation is finished. In the constructor, we initialize all handles and set the transaction count.

Inside the `run()` task, the generator creates `count` number of transactions. Each transaction is randomized, sampled for coverage, and then put into both mailboxes.

The generator also keeps track of how many write and read transactions were created using counters: `count_w` and `count_r`.

---

### Driver Class

Created `driver` class that takes transactions from the generator using the `gen2drv` mailbox and drives them to the DUT through the virtual interface `vif`.

In the constructor, the mailbox and interface are connected.

The `run()` task runs continuously using a `forever` loop. It gets each transaction from the mailbox, waits for the next **negative edge** of the clock, and drives the signals onto the interface.

- If the transaction is a **write**, it sets `write=1`, `read=0`, and sends `addr` and `data_in`.  
- If the transaction is a **read**, it sets `read=1`, `write=0`, and sends only the `addr`.

The driver also tracks how many transactions it has driven using `drv_count`, and prints status for each transaction.

---

## Task â€“ 3: Creating Monitor and Scoreboard Classes

### Monitor Class

The `monitor` class checks the DUTâ€™s output through the virtual interface `vif` and sends the observed transactions to the scoreboard using the `mon2scr` mailbox.  

In the constructor, it connects to the interface and the mailbox.

The `run()` task runs in a loop. On every **positive clock edge**, it creates a new transaction and captures all signals from the interface, including:
- `read`
- `write`
- `addr`
- `data_in`
- `data_out`

It then sends this transaction to the scoreboard for comparison with expected data.

If the transaction was a **read**, it prints the observed `addr` and `data_out` to help verify DUT response.

---

### Scoreboard Class

The `scoreboard` class checks if the DUT is working correctly by comparing expected and actual transactions.

It gets:
- Expected transactions from the generator via `gen2scr`
- Actual results from the monitor via `mon2scr`

It uses a `golden_model`, which is a simple array to remember all data written to memory.

- If the transaction is a **write**, it stores the `data_in` at the given `addr` in the model.
- If itâ€™s a **read**, it compares the `data_out` from the DUT with the stored value from the model.

If the values match, the test is marked **pass**. If not, it is a **fail**.  
It also counts total checks, passes, and errors.

---

## Task â€“ 4: Building the Environment & TB

### Environment Class

The `env` class connects and runs all parts of the testbench: generator, driver, monitor, and scoreboard.  
It creates three mailboxes for communication:

- `gen2drv` â†’ sends transactions from generator to driver  
- `gen2scr` â†’ sends expected transactions to scoreboard  
- `mon2scr` â†’ sends actual results from monitor to scoreboard  

In the constructor, it connects the virtual interface and creates all component objects.

The `test()` task starts all components in parallel using `fork...join_none`.

The `post_test()` task waits for the generator to finish and checks if the driver and scoreboard also completed the same number of transactions.  
It then prints a summary report showing:

- Total transactions generated  
- Read/write breakdown  
- Driver packet count  
- Scoreboard results (passes/failures)

The `run()` task simply calls `test()` and `post_test()` to run the full simulation.

---

### Top Module

The `tb` module is the top-level testbench that connects everything.  
It creates a clock signal that toggles every 5 time units.

It then instantiates:
- The interface `bus`, connected to the clock  
- The DUT `mem`, connected to the interface  
- The test environment `env`, which controls the whole simulation

Inside the `initial` block, the environment is created and passed the interface and transaction count.  
Then `env.run()` is called to start the simulation.

---

## Test Result

Ran the test by setting count to **771 transactions**.  
All transactions passed through the driver, DUT, and scoreboard with **no errors**.
